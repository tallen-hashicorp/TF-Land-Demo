# Before running the instruqt track
* Create a new workspace in org in TFC
* **OPTIONL** Create a API Token, this can be found in [User Setting/Tokens](https://app.terraform.io/app/settings/tokens)
    * This is created for you

# DO THIS STEP BEFORE STARTING THE DEMO!
Running the following script provides the Instruqt track your TFC organization and API token. **Note: use the org name not id**
```bash
~/setup/scripts/tfc-setup.sh
```
Note that when you paste the token, it will not be displayed; don't paste it twice.
